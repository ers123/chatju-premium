### Post Templates

**Template 1: "I Built This" (r/Korean)**
```markdown
Title: I built a Korean Saju (사주팔자) calculator with AI - would love feedback!

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm a Korean developer who's been working on making traditional Saju
readings accessible to international audiences.

For those who don't know: Saju (사주팔자) is the "Four Pillars of Destiny"
- the fortune-telling system you see in K-dramas like The Glory.

**What it does:**
- Calculates your Four Pillars based on exact birth time
- AI interprets the reading (trained on traditional Korean texts)
- Bilingual: Korean and English

**Why I built it:**
Growing up in Korea, visiting a 사주카페 was a rite of passage. But living
abroad now, I missed that cultural connection. Plus, international K-culture
fans kept asking "what's that fortune-telling thing in my favorite drama?"

**Current status:**
- ✅ Accurate Manseryeok (만세력) calculations
- ✅ AI interpretation in Korean + English
- 🎁 FREE beta testing (first 100 users)

**Would love feedback on:**
1. Is the interpretation culturally accurate?
2. Would you use this? Why or why not?
3. Pricing: Would $10 be fair for a detailed reading?

Thanks! 감사합니다 🙏
```

**Template 2: "K-Drama Question" (r/KDRAMA)**
```markdown
Title: What's the fortune-telling system they use in K-dramas? (The Glory, Nevertheless, etc.)

I've noticed fortune-telling scenes in multiple K-dramas:
- The Glory (Episode 3): Dong-eun gets her fortune read
- Nevertheless: Compatibility reading between leads
- Business Proposal: The saju matching scene

Is this a real thing or just plot device? What's it called?

EDIT: Wow, thank you for all the responses! Learned it's called "Saju"
(사주팔자) and it's actually super common in Korea.

Someone recommended I try [chatju.app] - apparently they're doing a
beta test (100 free readings). Just tried it... honestly kinda scary
how accurate it was? 👀

Anyone else tried it?
```

**Template 3: "Compatibility Test" (r/kpop fandom subreddits)**
```markdown
Title: [Fun] Which BTS/BLACKPINK member are you compatible with? (Korean Saju-based)

Okay so I found this Korean fortune-telling thing (Saju - the system
celebrities actually use) and it has a compatibility calculator.

Apparently compatibility is based on Five Elements:
- Wood (목) - Creative, growing
- Fire (화) - Passionate, energetic
- Earth (토) - Stable, nurturing
- Metal (금) - Structured, precise
- Water (수) - Intuitive, flowing

I'm Water-dominant... which means I'm most compatible with Metal types!

**My results:**
Most compatible with: Jin (Metal/Water balance)
Least compatible with: [redacted because stans will attack me 😅]

Try it: [chatju.app] (they have 100 free beta slots)

Drop your element + bias in comments! Let's see if we're destined 💜

## 🎬 Phase 2: "TikTok Seeding" (Days 3-7)

### Why TikTok?
- ✅ K-culture content EXPLODES on TikTok
- ✅ Algorithm favors niche + educational content
- ✅ Duet/Stitch features = built-in virality
- ✅ Young audience = early adopters

### Content Strategy: "Hook → Shock → CTA"

**Video 1: "I Tried Korean Fortune-Telling"**
```
Hook (0-3s): "So BTS uses THIS for fortune-telling?!"
Body (3-45s):
  - Show Four Pillars result on screen
  - React genuinely shocked: "Wait it says I'm..."
  - Read 2-3 accurate points
  - "How does it KNOW this?!"
Shock (45-55s): "This is 2,500 years old btw"
CTA (55-60s): "Link in bio - first 100 people get it FREE"

Hashtags: #Saju #KoreanFortuneTelling #Kpop #BTS #TheSameReading
#Kdrama #Astrology #Hallyu
```

**Video 2: "Korean vs Western Astrology"**
```
Hook (0-3s): "Western astrology: You're a Virgo"
Contrast (3-30s):
  Split screen comparison
  - Left: Generic Virgo description
  - Right: Specific Saju reading
Body (30-50s): "Which one sounds more like YOU?"
CTA (50-60s): "Try Korean fortune-telling - link in bio"

Hashtags: #Astrology #Saju #Korean #Virgo #ZodiacSigns #Accurate
```

**Video 3: "Bias Compatibility Test"**
```
Hook (0-3s): "POV: You're elementally compatible with Jungkook"
Body (3-45s):
  - Show compatibility percentage
  - Explain Five Elements quickly
  - "I'm Water, he's Fire... we balance!"
Shock (45-55s): "This is what Korean celebrities actually use"
CTA (55-60s): "Check your compatibility - link in bio"

Hashtags: #BTS #Jungkook #Compatibility #Saju #KoreanCulture #Army
```

### TikTok Growth Hacks

**Hack 1: "Duet Bait"**
Create a video that BEGS for duets:
```
Video: "Drop your birth date and I'll tell you your Korean element"
Result: Hundreds of people duet with their birth dates
Your response: Auto-reply template with element + link
```

**Hack 2: "Stitch Bait"**
Make a video with a controversial claim:
```
"Korean fortune-telling is more accurate than astrology and here's proof"
Result: Astrology TikTok stitches you (debate = engagement)
Algorithm: Pushes your video to both communities
```

**Hack 3: "Comment Pin Strategy"**
Pin this comment on EVERY video:
```
"🎁 First 100 people get FREE full reading (usually $10)
Not clickbait - link in bio
Only [X] spots left! ⏰"
```
Update the number daily to create urgency.

## 🔥 "Viral Ignition" Tactics

### Tactic 1: "First 10 Users = Mega Bonus"

```
🎁 FOUNDING MEMBER SPECIAL

First 10 beta testers get:
✅ FREE readings forever (even after launch)
✅ Lifetime premium features
✅ Name in "Hall of Fame" page
✅ $100 affiliate commission per referral

Only [7] spots left!
```

This creates EXTREME urgency + rewards early believers.

### Tactic 2: "K-Drama Release Timing"

Launch same week as popular K-drama episode featuring Saju:
```
Example:
- New season of "The Glory" drops Friday
- We launch Monday with Reddit post:
  "Just watched The Glory finale - here's the REAL Saju they used"
```

**Upcoming K-drama releases to watch:**
- Check MyDramaList for fortune-telling themes
- Time launch within 48 hours of episode

### Tactic 3: "Reddit AMA"

**Week 2**: Do an AMA on r/Korean or r/KDRAMA

```
Title: "I'm a Korean developer who built an AI Saju (사주)
fortune-teller - AMA about Korean culture, fortune-telling,
or building solo projects!"

Proof: [Link to ChatJu + GitHub]

This creates:
✅ Authority (developer credibility)
✅ Cultural authenticity (Korean-operated)
✅ Traffic spike (AMAs get 1,000+ upvotes)
```

### Tactic 4: "Influencer Bait"

DM 50 micro-influencers (5K-50K followers) in K-culture niche:

```
Hey [Name]!

Love your K-drama reviews! Quick Q:

I built a Korean Saju (사주) fortune-teller and would
love your authentic feedback as a K-culture expert.

Can I send you a FREE reading + early access?

No strings attached - just want input from someone
who gets Korean culture ❤️

Best,
Yohan
